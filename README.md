# Horiseon Landing Page/ Horiseon-refractor

## My motivation throughout the refractor was the Run-Buddy page that I worked on throughout the previous weeks. I did not build this assignment, but I made corrections to code because it will help me or others in the future not only read it for editing but for the webpage to read it better aswell. It solves the problem of images not having "alt" descriptions and a page full of "divs" along with comments of where a section starts and a new one begins. I learned how to organize html, and how to properly add tags that may seem meaningless but have big impact when its needed.
